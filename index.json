Hi~ I\u0026rsquo;m Yueyan Li, a researcher(still a student now) in China. I\u0026rsquo;m now at the Center of Intelligence Science and Technology, BUPT. My research focuses on machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing, mainly mechanistic interpretability now! Here is my CV.\nExcept from my research area, I\u0026rsquo;m also interested in communication engineering\u0026#x1f4fb; which was my major when I was an undergraduate. If you like that, feel free to share something interesting together~\nApart from technologies, I\u0026rsquo;m a lover for nature. I like the mountains, the rivers, the forests\u0026hellip;if you like hiking outdoors, don\u0026rsquo;t forget me! Also, I\u0026rsquo;m a Bboy\u0026#x270c;\u0026#xfe0f;\u0026#x1f918;. If you like breaking or any kind of street dance, just call me\u0026#x1f44b;!\nSometimes I paint as a waste of time, though I\u0026rsquo;m not professional.\nAbout my nickname I use the name Sirius/Sirius Jr./siriuslala\u0026hellip; everywhere on the Internet. This originates from Sirius Black-my favourite character in the Harry Potter series.\nHe is not only an extraodinary wizard with wild and intractable appearence but also the godfather of Harry Potter-the only family alive for Harry who had brought him warmth that is hard to replace. That\u0026rsquo;s why I admire him.\n","permalink":"https://Siriuslala.github.io/about/","summary":"About myself","title":"about"},{"content":"","permalink":"https://Siriuslala.github.io/faq/","summary":"faq","title":"faq"},{"content":"\rPrevious\rNext \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\r/ [pdf]\rView the PDF file here.\r","permalink":"https://Siriuslala.github.io/helper/","summary":"\rPrevious\rNext \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\r/ [pdf]\rView the PDF file here.\r","title":"Yueyan Li"}]
